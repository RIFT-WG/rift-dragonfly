1.  Introduction

   RIFT today is standardized to deal with CLOS variant fabrics with
   some horizontal link exceptions.  Given that interconnecting multiple
   CLOS via a dragonfly variant is an interesting topology (whether it's
   a full mesh or some kind of non-completely meshed regular lattice)
   this document addresses the resulting changes necessary to base RIFT
   specification to support dragonfly interconnected CLOS fabrics.  The
   reader be advised that due to complexity of figures involved the
   ASCII version of the document leaves those out.  To start, Figure 1
   visualizes three simple single plane fabrics interconnected via a
   DragonFly+ backbone.  The behavior of standard RIFT is better
   understood if we look at the homomorphic version of the same topology
   in Figure 2.  We can see that it is nothing else but a multi-plane
   CLOS with a lot of broken links for standard RIFT.  The planes
   consist of S_x_1 and S_x_2 ToFs in each CLOS.  Given this, leaf LB1
   should be connected to SA1 to be in the plane and since it is not,
   SA1 will deduct that leaf LB1 fell off the plane 1 and negatively
   disaggregate it.  Unfortunately the same is true for leaf LB1 from
   the view the SA2 in 2nd plane and it will negatively disaggregate it.
   Hence leaf LA1 will not have any possiblity to forward to LB1 using
   standard RIFT.  This points us already to the first modification
   needed, we have to relax RIFT to forward through the horizontal links
   on ToFs and this will be the starting point of the next section.
